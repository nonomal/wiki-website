### **Announce**: Linux 32-bit support ends soon

Typora is using [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) as framework to run on Linux / Windows. We are currently using Electron version 3.x, which will be the last version to support Linux on 32-bit architectures. As we are planning to move to Electron 4.x or 5.x soon (1-2 months), this means that Typora will no longer run on Linux 32-bit.
