### Update Mermaid Version

Mermaid version is now at 8.14.0, compared to previous version typora used, it now has:

- New `requirementDiagram` support, e.g:

  ```mermaid
  requirementDiagram
  
      requirement test_req {
      id: 1
      text: the test text.
      risk: high
      verifymethod: test
      }
  
      element test_entity {
      type: simulation
      }
  
      test_entity - satisfies -> test_req
  ```

  

- Other improvements, such as `erDiagram` can have keys and commands. For more improvements, see <https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/releases>.

  ```mermaid
  erDiagram
      CreativeWork {
        TEXT name_PK
        TEXT description
        TEXT reference_N
      }
  ```

### Images

#### Delete Image Files

Now you can now **delete** original image files from context menu, it will remove image item displayed in your markdown file as well as its original files in local disk. But please ensure no other files using that image file before you delete it from disk.

#### Move Images

In previous Typora versions, you move copy images to a given folder, but the original image file will still be kept. This version we introduced "image move", which allows you to move image from one location to another, update the references in Typora, and delete the original image files at disk.

#### Picsee as New Image Uploader

We are happy to announce that macOS users have a new option to [upload their images](/Upload-Image/) — [Picsee](https://enpicsee.chitaner.com/).

[Picsee](https://enpicsee.chitaner.com/) is an image viewer & organizer on macOS.

You could install it from [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1454805783). To configure Picsee to upload your images, please refer [this document](https://enpicsee.chitaner.com/blog/Typora_imageCloud_config.html).

#### Other relates to images

- Add a `Reload All Images` menu from `Format` → `Image` which will clear cache and force reload all images from local and remote websites. Please note that Typora already have a function to auto reload local images, but when it is not working or your images are stored in internet, this `Reload All Images` may help you.

- When you **undo** an image copy operation, newly copied image file will also be discard from local disk.

- We significantly improved the performance on (newer) macOS when you editing a markdown file contains lots of images. 

  Following is a sample file contains 85 images at total 72.5 MB:
