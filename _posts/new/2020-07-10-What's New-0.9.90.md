# New / Improvement

#### File

- Support file encode: UTF-8 with BOM.
- Improve sort in **sidebar**.

#### Markdown

- Able to parse Azure style `[[_TOC_]]` as Table of Content.

- Support `id` attribute as link anchors.

  Previously Typora only support this kind of anchor links:

  ```markdown
  <a name="target-1"></a>anchor
  
  <a href="#target-1">link to anchor</a>
  ```

  But `anchor` is deprecated in newer HTML rules. Now using `id` attribute is also supported:

  ```markdown
  <a id="target-1"></a>anchor
  
  <a href="#target-1">link to anchor</a>
  ```

- Improve table parsing rules.

#### Mermaid

##### Show error message for invalid mermaid diagrams.
