## Save Resources As…

You can now right click on a media resources (including [images, SVGs](/Images/), [videos](/Media/#video), [sequence chart, flowchart, mermaid diagrams](/Draw-Diagrams-With-Markdown/) and [math](/Math/)) to save the media content in separate files in your local disk.

For diagrams and math, you can save it in formats of sag, png and jpeg. Other resources like images and videos can be saved in their original format.

## Images

### Download / Move / Copy all images to folder

In this version, we added two new menu items

- `Format` → `Image` → `Copy All Images to`
- `Format` → `Image` → `Move All Images to`

They will copy or move all used images to new folder and update path references in your markdown file. If your image is remote images, then Typora will download and save them to the target folder.

### Auto move image folder

When you rename or move current document in Typora window, typora will now pop up a dialog to let you move your image folder if your image folder is tied with your file path / name. For example, if you set `${filename}.assets` as your image folder in preferences panel, and your current document name is `file 1`. Then if you rename the current opened file to `file 2`, then typora will helps you to move image folder from `file 1.assets` to `file 2.assets` and update references in current document.

Please note it now only works for rename or move **current** document **in** Typora file tree sidebar. On macOS, rename or move outside Typora window will also trigger this.

## Iframe (Windows / Linux)

From this version, `<iframe>` is fully supported in Windows / Linux. In previous versions, javascript is blocked in iframe unless the website is in our whitelist for security reasons. Now, javascript is supported in iframe, and is isolated with the main frame.

## Copy / Paste as

`Copy as HTML Code` and `Copy without Theme Styling ` is added as submenu item of `Copy / Paste As...` in context menu. In previous versions, user can only access them from menu bar or custom shortcut keys, now they are added in context menu for quick operations.
