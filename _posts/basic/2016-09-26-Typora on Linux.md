Installation instructions for different flavours of Linux.

## Debian/Ubuntu

```bash
# or use
# wget -qO - https://typora.io/linux/public-key.asc | sudo apt-key add -
wget -qO - https://typoraio.cn/linux/public-key.asc | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/typora.asc

# add Typora's repository
sudo add-apt-repository 'deb https://typora.io/linux ./'
sudo apt-get update

# install typora
sudo apt-get install typora
```

### Alternative for `apt-key`

When you try to add an APT repository key using `apt-key` (first line in previous command line) on Debian, Ubuntu and Linux distributions based on these, you'll see the following message: "*Warning: apt-key is deprecated. Manage keyring files in trusted.gpg.d instead (see apt-key(8))*".

The easiest way would be just to ignore it.

But if you’re not OK with the warning, you can do the following:

1. Download the key and save it locally somewhere.

   ```shell
   curl https://typora.io/linux/public-key.asc | gpg --dearmor > /usr/share/keyrings/typora.gpg
   ```

2. Create the repo file `typora.list` in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d`.

   ```shell
   sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list.d/typora.list
   ```

3. Paste the repo definition into this file:

   ```shell
   deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/typora.gpg] https://typora.io/linux ./
   ```

4. Now you can install Typora:

   ```shell
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install typora
   ```

### Upgrade Typora

After installing Typora, the `typora` package will be managed by `apt-get`, so when your system updates installed packages, or you execute `apt-get upgrade`, Typora will be updated to the latest version.

```bash
# upgrade all packages include Typora
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

## Mint

```sh
# or use
# sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys BA300B7755AFCFAE
wget -qO - https://typora.io/linux/public-key.asc | sudo apt-key add -

# add Typora's repository
echo -e "\ndeb https://typora.io/linux ./" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt-get update

# install typora
sudo apt-get install typora
```

## Download deb file manually

You can also manually download and install the deb package file by following these steps:

1. Find the download link from <https://typora.io/releases/all> and download the Linux version.
2. Double click the deb file to start installing on Ubuntu / Debian.

## ChromeOS / Chrome Book

Firstly, you will need to enable Linux on Chromebook by following the “Turn on Linux” part here https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9145439?hl=en

Then, input commands from https://typora.io/#linux into the newly opened terminal window.

## Other Distributions

1. Download the binary package [Typora-linux-x64.tar.gz](https://typora.io/linux/Typora-linux-x64.tar.gz).
2. Try to install `apt-get` on your distribution and then install Typora.

## Snap Version

You can also install Typora via `snap install typora`.

Please notice the [limitations of the snap version](/Snap/#limitations-for-the-snap-version).

## Wayland

For wayland, please append flags when launching Typora (see <https://blogs.igalia.com/msisov/2020/11/20/chrome-chromium-on-wayland-the-waylandification-project/>).

```
--enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland
```

## Distribution Support

Typora for Linux is tested only on Ubuntu. So, if you have a problem with other distributions, please email us at [hi@typora](http://mailto:hi@typora.io).

## Troubleshooting

### Common Solutions for Typora not opening

**Make sure all the necessary dependencies are installed**. You can run `ldd typora | grep not` on a Linux machine to check which dependencies are missing. 

#### Error on Debian Stretch

For the following error:

```
[8898:0620/213856.172363:FATAL:setuid_sandbox_host.cc(157)] The SUID sandbox helper binary was found, but is not configured correctly. Rather than run without sandboxing I'm aborting now. You need to make sure that /usr/share/typora/chrome-sandbox is owned by root and has mode 4755.
```

Try `chmod 4755 /usr/share/typora/chrome-sandbox`

See discussion in https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/17972

#### Cannot open Typora binary "there is no application installed for shared library"

When double clicking on Typora's binary file, Nautilus (file manager) doesn't run it as it can't detect it as an executable file.

This is caused by a Nautilus bug, see discussions in https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/15406. You can either: install Typora via `deb` or `apt-get`, or run Typora from the terminal (`./Typora`).

#### Started Typora and got `version GLIBCXX_3.4.21 not defined in file libstdc++.so.6` error

When  you start Typora on Ubuntu 14.x, if the following error happens: 

```
/usr/share/typora/Typora: relocation error: /usr/share/typora/resources/app/node_modules/spellchecker/build/Release/spellchecker.node: symbol _ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE10_M_replaceEmmPKcm, version GLIBCXX_3.4.21 not defined in file libstdc++.so.6 with link time reference
```

Then download the Debian version of package libstdc++6 for Xenial at the following link http://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/libstdc++6 and install it using `dpkg -I` (Reference: https://askubuntu.com/questions/777803/apt-relocation-error-version-glibcxx-3-4-21-not-defined-in-file-libstdc-so-6).

#### [Ubuntu 14.04 ] typora: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdbus-1.so.3: no version information available (required by Typora)

See [electron/electron#16364 (comment)](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/16364#issuecomment-492199424)

#### Error while loading shared libraries: libgconf-2.so.4

Try installing `libgconf-2-4` first.

#### NSS out-of-date

If you receive the following error when launching Typora:

```
[7465:7499:0911/174740.042852:FATAL:nss_util.cc(632)] NSS_VersionCheck("3.26") failed. NSS >= 3.26 is required. Please upgrade to the latest NSS, and if you still get this error, contact your distribution maintainer.
Aborted
```

then:
1. Ensure `xenial-security` updates are included in *Software & Updates*.
2. run `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libnss3`

#### Malformed input, repository not added

You can add a repository by:

```sh
echo -e "\ndeb https://typora.io/linux ./" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
```

See related discussion in <https://github.com/typora/typora-issues/issues/2065#issuecomment-455877843>. 

#### Shortcut for Heading 5 is not working

Please check if you use fcitx (e.g. for typing Chinese)? <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>5</kbd> is the global shortcut key for fcitx to reload its config. Deleting that global shortcut should make <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>5</kbd> work in Typora. (Thanks to https://github.com/typora/typora-issues/issues/867#issuecomment-647082881).

#### libva error: vaGetDriverNameByIndex() failed with unknown libva error, driver_name = (null)

Try launching Typora with the extra argument `--disable-gpu`.

#### Text not displayed in dialogs

![text not displayed in open file dialog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26056183/89756594-a3094c80-db00-11ea-943c-f214fea0c5ef.png)

Please refer to <https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/5217#issuecomment-700707564>

#### Save-as or Save file dialog cannot be displayed

When you save or save-as a file, the dialog does not pop up and in terminal you get: 

```
(typora:114856): Gtk-WARNING **: 15:47:01.744: Can't open portal file chooser: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.portal.Error.InvalidArgument: invalid filter: no filters
```

Then, you can try running Typora with `GTK_USE_PORTAL=0 typora`
