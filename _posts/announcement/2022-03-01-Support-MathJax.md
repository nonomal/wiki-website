We are proud to announce that we will financially support [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) from 2022. [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) is the open source math rendering engine used by Typora, and by many other websites and projects as well.

> “We really appreciate the support provided by Typora,” said Davide Cervone, the lead developer for MathJax. “This support allows us to continue to grow MathJax’s features in version 3.”
