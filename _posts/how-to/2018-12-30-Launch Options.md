When typora is launched, you could set default actions to:

- Open new file
- Restore last closed folder
- Restore last closed file and folder
- Open a custom folder.

This option can be set in preferences panel:

Note: on **macOS**, if "Close windows when quitting an app" is unchecked, then unclosed app from last launch will still be opened automatically.
