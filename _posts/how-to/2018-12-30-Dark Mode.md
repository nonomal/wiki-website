You can set separate themes for light mode and dark mode. When the system’s color scheme changed, the corresponding theme you chose will be applied.

Your theme can also use media query for [prefers color scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) to write a responsive theme for both light mode and dark mode.
