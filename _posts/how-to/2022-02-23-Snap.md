## Limitations for the Snap version

- Snap version is sandboxed.
- Snap version only have access to your home folder (`~/`) and removable media (`/media`).
- Snap version cannot execute binaries under `/usr/bin/` and `/usr/local/bin`, because it only have access to your home folder (https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/system-files-request-for-typora-snap-app/28740). 
  - The snap version includes pandoc, which can be used by Typora, but isolated to your system.
  - If you need to run other commands for export, upload image, etc, you will need to install, or put or link those binaries under your home folder (`~/`).
