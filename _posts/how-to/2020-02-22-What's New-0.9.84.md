# New

### Upload Images

Now Typora on all OS supports upload images. Previously, we only support integration with iPic on macOS, now we added support for uPic (macOS), PicGo-Core, PicGo.app (Chinese Language Only), and custom commands. So users in all operation system now have free options to upload images.

For details, please [check here](/Upload-Image).

# Improvement

### Footnote Quick Jump

For the [footnote](/Markdown-Reference/#footnotes) syntax, we will append an <a href="#">â†©</a> link after its definition when it is used. And user will jump to its references by clicking the link. Also for the reference of footnote (like `[^footnote]`), user can jump it is definition quickly by clicking it when pressing `ctrl` or `command` (macOS) key.
