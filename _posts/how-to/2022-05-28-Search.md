## Find and Replace (Search in current file)

You can use `command + F` (or `ctrl + F` on Windows / Linux) to toggle `Find` panel, and use `command + H` (or `ctrl + H` on Windows / Linux) to toggle `Find and Replace` panel to find contents in current document and replace matches.

Please note when [Regular Expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) is enabled, the `$0`, `$1`, `$3`… in  replacement string will be replaced by the matches in brackets. 

## File Search (Search across files)

You can open this search function by

- Click the “search” icon in sidebar when `File Tree` or `Articles` sidebar is shown.
- Click `View` → `Search` from menu bar, or using the shortcut key displayed in the menu item directly.

Similar with find and replace, it supports toggles of case sensitive / insensitive, match whole word, and match with regular expression.
