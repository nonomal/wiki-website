## Basic Usage

The following markdown syntax will be rendered as a **Task List**:

```gfm
- [ ] This task is incomplete.
- [x] This task is completed.
```

## Quickly Changing Task Status

1. Simply click on the checkbox of a task list, or —

2. Select menu items under `Paragraph` → `Task Status`;

Follow the [Custom Key Binding](/Shortcut-Keys/#change-shortcut-keys) instructions to assign shortcut keys as needed.

## "Erasing" Completed Tasks

You may want to add a strikethrough on completed tasks automatically like this:

![Snip20170824_1](/media/task-list/Snip20170824_1.png) 

This can be achieved by adding the following Custom CSS:

```css
.task-list-done {
    /* styles for completed tasks */
    text-decoration: line-through;
}
.task-list-not-done {
    /* styles for incomplete tasks */
}
```

If you want a completed task list to display with less contrast, you can add CSS in the format `color: #777` to change the text color for selector `.task-list-done`.

For details on where to put this CSS, please read [Add Custom CSS](/Add-Custom-CSS/).
