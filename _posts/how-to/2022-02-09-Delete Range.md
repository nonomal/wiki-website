## Delete Paragraph / Block

In Typora, contents are separated by paragraph-level blocks, including headings, paragraph, list items, etc. This action will remove current paragraph-level blocks.

## Delete Line / Sentence

Please note that the behavior of "Delete Line / Sentence" in Typora is different with "Delete Line" in code editors or IDEs.

In a paragraph, delete line / sentence will delete current sentence. In a table, it delete current table row. In code block or math block, it remove current line just like other code editors. If a paragraph or block is empty, it will delete current empty block.
