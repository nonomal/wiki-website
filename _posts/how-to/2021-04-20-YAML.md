* Outline
{:toc}
The [YAML](https://yaml.org/) front matter must be the first thing in the file and must be valid YAML, set between triple-dashed lines. For example, the following markdown file uses YAML front matter to define meta data like title, category, tags, etc.

```markdown
---
title: YAML Front Matter
category: how-to
author: typora.io
tags: [YAML, metadata, tags]
typora-root-url: ../../
---

### Using the Variables on Export

#### Summary

The meta data will be used in export. For example, when exporting markdown file above into HTML format, typora will output `<title>YAML Front Matter</title>` into HTML `<head>` Element. And author will be added as meta data when exported to PDF or pub format.

#### Using Custom Content in Exported HTML

You can add custom contents in `Append in <head />` and `Append in <body />`, which will be inserted into `<head />` part and `<body />` part in the exported html.

Variables like `${title}` or `${author}` in `<title>` and `<meta>` tag will be replaced by corresponding [variables](#variables) defined in [YAML Front Matter][yaml].

For example, you can insert additional `<meta>` data or custom `<style>` into exported html using those options, e.g:
```html
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="author" content="${author}">
<meta name="description" content="${description}">
```

To use those variables somewhere else, you can add some javascript in `Append in <body />`, to read target meta tag, and modify exported content as you want.

#### Using metadata in Exported PDF

You can add metadata to exported PDF file via [YAML Front Matter][yaml]. The following are the supported PDF metadata:

```gfm
---
title: Export in Typora
author: John Snow
creator: Typora inc.
subject: Tutorial
keywords: [Pandoc, Tutorial, Export]
---
```

**Note:** when "keywords" are absent, typora will also use "tags", and you can use the YAML indentation to represent an array, for instance:

```gfm
---
tags:
    - Pandoc
    - Tutorial
    - Export
---
```

You could also use custom meta tag by adding `<meta>` tags and custom scripts in `Append Extra Content` field using same approach as HTML export.

You could also use custom meta tag in header and footer for exported PDF.

#### Using in Pandoc-based Export

Pandoc also supports certain meta data options, similar to LaTeX export. The following will be added in the exported LaTeX file:

```markdown
---
header-includes: |
    \usepackage{fancyhdr}
    \pagestyle{fancy}
    \fancyhead[CO,CE]{This is fancy}
    \fancyfoot[CO,CE]{So is this}
    \fancyfoot[LE,RO]{\thepage}
---
```

You could find more in <https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#variables>

### Using as Variables / Settings on 3rd Party Tools

More commonly, YAML front matter will be in 3rd party tools, like static website generators or blog systems based on markdown files. For example, [Jekyll uses YAML Front Matter this way](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/).
### Use in per-document configuration

#### Images

| key                   | Description                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| typora-root-url       | The base path for image resources, see [detail](https://support.typora.io/Images/). |
| typora-copy-images-to | Actions when user insert or drag & drop images into Typora, see [detail](https://support.typora.io/Images/). |

#### Export

Since the markdown file may be created by others, for security reasons, native supported formats (PDF / HTML) require "Read and overwrite export settings from YAML front matter" to be enabled in export preferences panel, then settings in YAML front matter can be used and overwrite global export settings.

| key                                             | description                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| header<br />typora-header                       | Header part of PDF export, see [detail](/Export/#header--footer). |
| footer<br />typora-footer                       | Footer part of PDF export, see [detail](/Export/#header--footer). |
| sidebar<br />typora-sidebar                     | true \| false<br />Whether to include sidebar or not in exported HTML. (Not supported in HTML (without style)) |
| append-head<br />typora-append-head             | Data that will be inserted into `<head>` tag, after HTML export, see [detail](/Export/#append-contents-per-document). |
| append-body<br />typora-append-body             | Data that will be inserted into `<body>` tag, after HTML export, see [detail](/Export/#append-contents-per-document). |
| append-head-extra<br />typora-append-head-extra | Data that will be inserted into `<head>` tag, in addition of the global append-head setting, after HTML / PDF export, see [detail](/Export/#append-contents-per-document). |
| append-body-extra<br />typora-append-body-extra | Data that will be inserted into `<body>` tag, in addition of the global append-body setting, after HTML / PDF export, see [detail](/Export/#append-contents-per-document). |
| Others                                          | For pandoc export formats, some other settings will be parse from yaml meta data, like `header-includes:`, see [pandoc manual](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#variables) for details. |

### YAML Basics

Rules to notice in YAML:
- Only whitespace is supported for indentation, tab is not supported, and indentation is very important in YAML.
- Usually, keys in YAML are case-sensitive.
- Typora parses YAML front matter in very "flexible" or "fault-tolerant" way, to avoid large content change during YAML editing. And we don't recommend to put too much stuff in YAML front matter.
